(does not run jet, NO_PNG mandatory as png/zlib not in 64 bit)

How to build qzint.exe using:
- QT 5.7 installed in C:\qt\Qt5.7.1
  32 bit (use the offline installer and the 32 bit package)
- MS Visual Studio 2015 (VC12)

Folder structure:
- zint source files in $ZH
  -> this file is in $ZH\frontend_qt
- png1620.zip unzipped in $ZH\..\lpng
  -> $ZH\..\lpng\png.h exists
- zlib128.zip unzipped in folder $ZH\..\zlib
  -> $ZH\..\zlib\zlib.h exists

Build libpng:
Open $ZH\..\lpng\projects\vstudio with VS2015 gui and convert the project
Copy the zlib source as required by the make file (in my case: zlib-1.2.8)
Build targets "Release Library" for zlib and libpng.

Build zint

- Start in the start menu: "VS2015 x64 Native Tools-Eingabeaufforderung"
- set PATH=C:\Qt\Qt5.7.1\5.7\msvc2015\bin;%PATH%
- cd $ZH
- cd backend_qt
- qmake backend_qt.pro
- nmake clean
- nmake release
    
- cd ..\frontend_qt
- qmake frontend_qt.pro
- nmake clean
- nmake release
  -> qzint.exe is in the release folder

For me, it only runs, if I add the following files in the folder (from the QT bin folder):
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll

InnoSetup Studio may be used to build the setup file.
